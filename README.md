 When playing Tic-Tac-Toe, there are several simple and easy-to-follow rules that you should observe. The rules that you need to be aware of include the following:

  *  The traditional version of Tic-Tac-Toe must be played on a 3Ã—3 grid that incorporates 9 squares.
  *  Players must select their mark before the game starts (either X or O) and must play the entire game using the same mark.
  *  Players must take turns, making only 1 mark with each turn.
  *  Marks can only be placed in empty squares, and once it is placed, it is permanent.
  *  The winner is the first player to get 3 of their marks in a straight line (the line can be positioned diagonally, vertically, or horizontally).
  *  The game is over when all 9 squares are filled with marks, even if none of the players have a straight line of 3 marks.
  *  If neither player has a straight line of 3 marks, it is considered a tie.
